Previously, I used to manually write all my code to make a website, but it was very time-consuming, so I did a little bit of searching for a blogging software and I found 3 main ones:

- [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/)
  - Free
  - You have to install a lot of things
  - I was looking for a simple one
- [Ghost](https://ghost.org/)
  - Not free
  - I was searching for a free blogging software
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
  - Free
  - Easy to install

I selected Jekyll to use
